* Implement remaining available API functions -- fetch full team list, awards, etc.
* Improve colors & formatting
* Simplify printing process
* Search for teams by name?
* Search for events to avoid having to memorize exact keys
* Switch from a TBA system to a more general FRC tool
* Better error handling for input omission
